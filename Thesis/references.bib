abstract="We propose a Dynamic-Spatial-Attention (DSA) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for anticipating accidents in dashcam videos (Fig. 1). Our DSA-RNN learns to (1) distribute soft-attention to candidate objects dynamically to gather subtle cues and (2) model the temporal dependencies of all cues to robustly anticipate an accident. Anticipating accidents is much less addressed than anticipating events such as changing a lane, making a turn, etc., since accidents are rare to be observed and can happen in many different ways mostly in a sudden. To overcome these challenges, we (1) utilize state-of-the-art object detector [3] to detect candidate objects, and (2) incorporate full-frame and object-based appearance and motion features in our model. We also harvest a diverse dataset of 678 dashcam accident videos on the web (Fig. 3). The dataset is unique, since various accidents (e.g., a motorbike hits a car, a car hits another car, etc.) occur in all videos. We manually mark the time-location of accidents and use them as supervision to train and evaluate our method. We show that our method anticipates accidents about 2 s before they occur with 80{\%} recall and 56.14{\%} precision. Most importantly, it achieves the highest mean average precision (74.35{\%}) outperforming other baselines without attention or RNN.",

  abstract = "We present a novel unsupervised learning method for human action categories. A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points. The algorithm automatically learns the probability distributions of the spatial-temporal words and the intermediate topics corresponding to human action categories. This is achieved by using latent topic models such as the probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our approach can handle noisy feature points arisen from dynamic background and moving cameras due to the application of the probabilistic models. Given a novel video sequence, the algorithm can categorize and localize the human action(s) contained in the video. We test our algorithm on three challenging datasets: the KTH human motion dataset, the Weizmann human action dataset, and a recent dataset of figure skating actions. Our results reflect the promise of such a simple approach. In addition, our algorithm can recognize and localize multiple actions in long and complex video sequences containing multiple motions.",
