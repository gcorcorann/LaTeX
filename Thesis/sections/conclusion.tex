This paper presented the problem of estimating the driver's required attention via outward-facing dashcam videos. The proposed multiple neural network architecture uses appearance and motion features and recurrent neural network. We achieve a real-time system that helps alert the driver when a high or very high attention level is required with an accuracy twice that of <<insert accuracy>>. Our final experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple outward facing dashcam.
Moving forward, we would like to continue this research to explore how including other fast processing features could help improve the accuracy while still maintaining results in real-time.
